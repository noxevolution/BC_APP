<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT COLOR="#ff950e">Forecasting</FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">The forecasting pane allows you to forecast future
values of a timeseries by entering future values of timeseries upon
which it depends.</P>
<P CLASS="western">For example, if sales are related to advertising
expenditure, entering larger values for future expenditure should
cause future values of the sales timeseries to increase.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Display</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The display is divided into three sections. Graphs
in the top section (target timeseries) represent the timeseries that
we are going to forecast. The background of these graphs is coloured
pink. Below this is the x-axis which shows values of time for all
graphs. Blow this is a collection of timeseries (source timeseries)
whose future values can be provided to see the effect on the top
graphs.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Future values, i.e. values of timeseries beyond
the end of data available in the application are shown in the lower
graphs as small red squares on a red curve. You can grab each of
these points and move them to new positions. Alternatively,
double-clicking on them allows you to enter their new values from the
keyboard.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If there is any dependency between the source
graphs and the target graphs, the effect of these changes should be
seen immediately in the target graphs at the top of the pane.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">Showing Target
Timeseries</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">You can display one or
more target graphs in this pane. To add a new target graph, click on
the 'Add Target Graph' button in the Layout Controls toolbox. If you
can't see this toolbox, click on Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Layout Controls to
display it. When you display a new target timeseries graph it shows
the first timeseries in the timeseries set that is not already
displayed in this pane, either as a source or a target graph.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.05cm">Showing Source
Timeseries</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.05cm">You can display any
number of source graphs in this pane. To add a new source graph,
click on the 'Add Source Graph' button in the Layout Controls
toolbox. If you can't see this toolbox, click on Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Layout
Controls to display it. When you display a new source timeseries
graph it shows the first timeseries in the timeseries set that is not
already displayed in this pane, either as a source or a target graph.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">Selecting Timeseries</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">You can alter which
timeseries a graph displays either by clicking the popup menu above
the graph or by dragging a node to that menu from the selection tree
(Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Selection Tree)</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.05cm">Removing Graphs</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">To remove a graph,
press the small button with a red cross on it at the top right-hand
corner of the graph. You may display a minimum of one target
timeseries.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">Panning and Zooming</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">Clicking on the
background of any of the graphs and sliding the mouse right or left
whilst holding down the mouse button allows you to move the display
of all graphs to the right or to the left, so as to show either more
historic or more future values of all timeseries.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.03cm">Use your mouse wheel
to zoom.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Displaying Timeseries
Values</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Hovering over a point
on any of the graphs causes the value of that point to be displayed
textually in the form of a tooltip.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">Changing Future
Values of Source Timeseries</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">Values in the 'future'
of all source graphs are displayed with a red curve and the future
points are depicted by small red squares. Each of these future points
can be dragged to a new position using the mouse. Alternatively,
double-clicking on a point allows you to enter the value of that
point from the keyboard.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">Changing the Number
of Future Periods Displayed</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">By using the spin box
in the Layout Controls toolbox ( Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Layout Controls)
you can choose how many 'future' values to display. You can display
any number of 'future values', though forecast values more than a few
time periods into the future may be of little practical use. 'Future'
is defined as those periods more to the future than the data in this
particular database. A timeseries does not necessarily run to the end
of the database and it may stop short. For example, if a
monthly-sampled database runs from January to December and the
timeseries we are studying only has values until September, then we
have the opportunity to predict its values from October and beyond.
In this case, setting the value of 'Future Periods' to zero (i.e.
nothing beyond December) will still show forecast values for this
timeseries up until the end of the year. If this is not required, the
Future Periods spinbox can take on negative values.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Automatic Selection
of Source Graphs</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">When you add a new
target timeseries, or when you change the timeseries that a target
graph displays, the application selects a number of source timeseries
for you and displays them in this pane. It will select a maximum of
'Influences to add' timeseries (you can alter this value in the
Layout Controls Toolbox, Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Layout Controls). If any
of these timeseries is not currently displayed either as a target or
a source graph, its display is added to the pane as a source
timeseries. The timeseries selected for inclusion in this way are
those with the greatest coefficient of influence over the target
timeseries.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Zeroing Source Graphs</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">Pressing the small
button with a zero on it, next to the delete button for each graph,
causes user-entered future values of this timeseries to be reset to
their initial values. Initial future values of a timeseries are
simply the most-recent recorded value of that timeseries.</P>
