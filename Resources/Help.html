<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="Help_html_m7b856732.jpg" NAME="graphics18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=1220 HEIGHT=634 BORDER=0>The
BrandCommunities application provides an environment and tools to
help you to identify non-obvious relationships between disparate
<A HREF="#timeseries">timeseries</A> data. For example, we might wish
to see if there is any relationship between average earnings and
house prices. But we can also analyse timeseries far more disparate
than this. For example length of holidays and sugar consumption.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A database containing all timeseries we wish to
analyse and compare is loaded into the application (<A HREF="#fileopen">File-&gt;Open</A>).
These timeseries are displayed in a tree in the <A HREF="#selector">Selector</A>
and as <A HREF="#nodes">nodes</A> in the <A HREF="#universe">Universe
graph</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Universe graph shows only the relationships
between timeseries data, not the data of the timeseries themselves.
Each timeseries is represented as a coloured circle (a node).
Straight lines (<A HREF="#links">links</A>) represent the
correlations between nodes. Links can be green (positive correlation)
or red (negative correlation). The thickness of links indicates the
strength of the correlation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Once the graph has been laid out by <A HREF="#centering">centring</A>
a node (double-clicking on any node), the relative positions of nodes
also indicates correlation strength: nodes with strong positive or
negative correlations will tend to appear close together whilst nodes
with poor correlations will tend to be further apart. Click <A HREF="#centering">here</A>
for details of this process. Many functions and options exist to help
identify relationships here. Click <A HREF="#universefunctions">here</A>
for the full details.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The <A HREF="#xyplot">XY Plot</A> lets you plot
the relationship in time between groups of three timeseries. These
are called <A HREF="#associations">associations</A>. You can display
as many associations concurrently as you wish.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The application remembers your configuration for
each database and loads it automatically for your when the
application is started and when you change database.</P>

<P CLASS="western">An association is a group of three timeseries

second timeseries representing y and a third timeseries representing
the <A HREF="#bubbles">bubble</A> size. As the <A HREF="#timeslider">Time

all are the <A HREF="#expandcollapse">expand/collapse</A> state of

one or more nodes to be obscured by other nodes. Without
declustering, nodes with correlations of +/- 1.0 will be laid out as
closely together as possible. (Note that if their correlations with
the central node differ they cannot be coincident because the
distance between the central node and a non-central node is fixed.)
In order to reduce the incidence of clustering you can check the

closely-correlating nodes, though it is not guaranteed to be

<P CLASS="western">In order to lay out the <A HREF="#nodes">nodes</A>
(<A HREF="#timeseries">timeseries</A>) in the <A HREF="#universe">Universe
graph</A> a bespoke graphing layout algorithm is employed. Whilst the
methods used in this calculation are straightforward the consequences
can be complex so here is a moderately-detailed description of that
algorithm:</P>
<P CLASS="western">We place one selected node in the centre of the
graph. This is the <A HREF="#centering">central node</A> (or the
<I>centred node</I>), chosen by the user double-clicking any node in
the Universe graph or in the <A HREF="#selector">Selector</A>. There
are two blue circles which are permanently displayed in this graph.
They are concentric with the central node. The smaller of the two
circles represents a correlation of 1.0 (or -1.0) with the central
node. So no node may be nearer to the central node than this blue
circle. Put another way, if a non-central node has a correlation of
+/- 1.0 with the central node it will be placed on this smaller blue
circle.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The large of the blue circles represents a
correlation of 0.0 with the central node. So no node may be further
from the central node than this blue circle. Put another way, is a
node has zero correlation with the central node it will be placed on
this larger outer circle.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Correlations between these two extremes are spaced
linearly between the two circles. Each node is now free to be placed
anywhere on the circle described by its correlation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">This distance is precise and reliable and it does
not change no matter which <A HREF="#universefunctions">layout
options</A> are chosen to display the graph.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The second consideration in laying out the
Universe nodes is the distances between non-central nodes, i.e. the
distance between each pair of nodes where neither node is the central
nodes. We seek to represent these correlations in the same way as we
did for central nodes, i.e. the distance between the nodes represents
the strength of the correlation between them. In practice we can very
rarely achieve this because a precise solution requires a graph in
N-1 dimensions (where N is the number of nodes) and we only have two
dimensions in which to display them. So we try to ensure that these
distances are indicative of their associated correlations. Even this
we cannot always achieve because in some circumstances nodes with
very low correlations may be forced together whilst well-correlating
nodes may be forced apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In order to get the best compromise we use a <A HREF="#leastsquares">least
squares</A> algorithm. The result will, in most circumstances, be a
fairly useful laying out of nodes, though small anomalies will
sometimes arise. Ideally we want non-correlating nodes to be
separated by the diameter of the large blue circle and
perfectly-correlating nodes to be to be separated by a small
distance, for example 50 pixels on the screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, we have to consider declustering. <A HREF="#links">Links</A>
can be perceived as springs between nodes, with low-correlating links
<I>pushing</I> their connected nodes <I>apart</I> and
high-correlating links <I>pulling</I> their connected nodes <I>together</I>.
The final layout will be an equilibrium state where the pushings and
pullings all balance. If, for example, 50 nodes are all pushing two
nodes closer together than they would like to be, the single 'spring'
between them will be swamped by the <I>pushings</I> and <I>pullings</I>
of the other 50 'springs'. So, what we do in this case is provide a
special 'spring' between two nodes when they get very close together.
This <I>special</I> 'spring' pushes the two nodes apart more and more
strongly as the two nodes approach each other. The result is an
equilibrium state that is effective for the majority of cases (it
keeps nodes from becoming coincident) but that can sometimes leave
two nodes overlapping when there are many powerful effects in play.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Bear in mind that the solution adopted is not the
only solution to this problem. Other solutions will produce quite
different graph layouts and perhaps be equally valid. The
particularity of the algorithm adopted is that it respects the
distances between central nodes and non-central nodes. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A HREF="#leastsquares" NAME="leastsquares">Least
Squares</A></H2>
<P CLASS="western">Least Squares is the most commonly algorithm used
to fit a curve to a set of data points. It is an iterative process
that seeks to minimise the 'error' between the data points and the
solution curve. At its simplest it is used to fit a straight line to
a set of experimentally-collected data points which contain a degree
of scatter. Put another way, a set of data points that is supposed to
represent a straight line may contain effects that cause those
experimental observations to stray away from the straight line that
is supposed to connect them all. In order to calculate the 'best fit'
straight line we propose some straight line or other and calculate
just how wrong we were by computing the 'error' between that line and
the data points. If we then propose a different straight line,
calculate the error in the same way and find that the error is
smaller than in our first attempt we know that our second attempt is
'better' than our first. If not, we abandon our second attempt and
try a third. If we continue in this way, choosing our subsequent
straight lines with a little intelligence we can keep reducing the
'error' until it becomes acceptably small.</P>
<P CLASS="western">We use a form of this algorithm to find the 'best'
placement of nodes in the <A HREF="#universe">Universe graph</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I>Least Squares</I> describes the means we use to
calculate the 'error' between our proposed solution and the data we
have. The optimal zero-error solution is generally-unobtainable but
if it exists it should be found. In <I>least squares </I>the error is
calculated by summing the squares of the differences between each
data point and our proposed solution.</P>

<P CLASS="western">Links represent <A HREF="#correlation">correlations</A>
between <A HREF="#nodes">nodes</A> in the <A HREF="#universe">Universe

the circles representing nodes (<A HREF="#timeseries">timeseries</A>).
Links can be red (when the correlation is negative) and green (when
the correlation is zero or positive). A peculiarity of the
application is that correlations (and hence links) exist between each
node and every other node. If there are N nodes then there will be N
* (N-1) / 2 links. So, for a Universe consisting of 50 nodes there
will be 1225 links. For a Universe of 100 nodes there will be nearly
5000 links.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The thickness of a link represents the strength of
the correlation, with zero correlation giving a link thickness of 1,
and a correlation of +/- 1.0 giving a link thickness of 5. Link
thicknesses are integer numbers and are only relative, so there is no
absolute unit of thickness. If you <A HREF="#zoom">zoom</A> into the
Universe graph the thickness of links will increase according to the
zoom factor.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Links are always displayed 'behind' nodes and so

The Universe graph is a two-dimensional graphical display of
<A HREF="#timeseries">timeseries</A> where a timeseries is
represented as a <A HREF="#nodes">node</A> (a coloured blob). Each
timeseries is separated from another timeseries according to the
correlation between those timeseries. If two timeseries <A HREF="#correlation">correlate</A>
closely they will be close together in the Universe graph. If they
don't correlate well they will be far apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">
A <A HREF="#correlation">correlation</A> is represented as a straight
line between two <A HREF="#timeseries">timeseries</A> (nodes) with
the thickness of the line indicating the strength of the correlation
and the colour representing its sign; negative correlations are shown
in red and positive correlations in green. The thickness of the line
represents the strength of the correlation (a thickness of 1 for zero
correlation and 5 for a correlation of +1.0 or -1.0, the maximum).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">
Note that in the Universe graph a timeseries is treated as a simple
object and the details of the series it represents is not used here.
If you want to see the timeseries data, select <A HREF="#profilenode">Profile</A>
or <A HREF="#normalisedprofilenode">Normalised Profile</A> in a
node's <A HREF="#nodecontextmenu">context-sensitive menu</A>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">
The graph is calculated and plotted by <A HREF="#centering">double-clicking</A>
on a node. That node is brought to the centre of the graph and all
remaining nodes are displayed around it. The smaller blue circle
represents the maximum correlation of any node with the central node
and so no node may be closer to the central node than this blue
circle. The larger blue circle represents the minimum correlation of
any node with the central node and so no node may be further away
from the central node than this blue circle. These distances are
precise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">
However, the distance between the non-central nodes is a compromise
(calculated using a <A HREF="#leastsquares">least squares</A>
approach) which attempts to indicate the strength of the correlation
between each pair of nodes by their separation. The reason these
distances are not precise is because it is impossible to map an
n-dimensional graph to two dimensions. Also, attempts are made to
avoid multiple nodes being piled on top of each other
(de-clustering). The diameter of the large blue circle represents the
minimum correlation (zero) between two non-central nodes.</P>

You can choose which nodes to display in the Universe graph by

	<LI><P CLASS="western"><A HREF="#linkopacity">Link opacity</A>:

	<LI><P CLASS="western"><A HREF="#linkcutoff">Link cutoff</A>: Allows
	you to control whether or not links with small correlation values
	are displayed. Setting this to 1.0 means that only links
	representing a correlation of 1.00 will be displayed. Setting this
	to 0.00 means that all links will be displayed. Because there is a
	link from each to every node, the graph can get quite cluttered if

	but it means that cross correlations will be removed more easily by
	the cutoff slider than correlations to the central-node. It works by
	effectively multiplying the value of a cross correlation by the
	maximum of all correlations to the central node. If the maximum
	correlation with the central node is 1.0 this toggle has no effect.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><A HREF="#declustering">Decluster</A>:
	Toggling this option on will attempt to reduce the incidence of
	nodes piling up on top of each other (and hence obscuring each

<P CLASS="western">Pressing the <A HREF="#playbutton">Play button</A>
causes the advancement of associations to be played out like a movie,
starting at the current position of the time slider and stopping
either when the movie reaches the end (right hand end of the time
slider) or when you press the pause button. The duration of the movie
is set by the <A HREF="#durationdial">Duration</A> dial. This can be
altered at any time, even whilst playing a movie. The duration value
represents the total time to play the movie from beginning to end.</P>
<P CLASS="western">For databases containing few different times the
movement of the bubbles in the graph will be &quot;jumpy&quot; as
they move from one discrete position to the next. By toggling the

transitions appear continuous.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The <A HREF="#dimmer">Dimmer</A> dial allows you
